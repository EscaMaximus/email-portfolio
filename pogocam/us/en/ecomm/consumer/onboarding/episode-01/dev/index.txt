Get Started with PogoCam

Part 1: wearing PogoCam, taking photos, recording video

PogoCam is a small, versatile camera unlike any you've used before. If you've already received your PogoCam, the Quick Start Guide and Wallet Card are all you need to get started taking photos and videos from your point of view. 

If you want a more detailed look at using PogoCam, we have a Getting Started series on our blog. In this email, we'll link to the basics: wearing the camera, taking photos, and recording videos.

In tomorrow's email, we'll introduce you to storing, charging, and transferring your images.
