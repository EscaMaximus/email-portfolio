What's next for PogoCam?

With the launch of PogoCam coming up, we've got to start thinking about what's next. We've got a lot of ideas, but we want to hear from you!

This is a unique opportunity to try out PogoCam in person and provide feedback to help inform the future of the product. If you are selected for this study, you will meet with one of our design researchers for a half hour conversation on new features of PogoCam. As a thank you for your time, we will compensate you with a $50 Amazon gift card.
