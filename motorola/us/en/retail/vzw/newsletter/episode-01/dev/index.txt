Moto Z Droid with Moto Mods(tm)

goodbye same. hello moto.

Earlier this month, Moto's TV, Social, Digital, and Retail marketing campaign featuring Moto Z(tm) and Moto Mods(tm) kicked off. Verizon also launched its own national TV campaign. Both efforts will drive customers into stores to demo and buy Moto Z and Moto Mods.

Attach Moto Mods to Moto Z Droid and it instantly transforms into a movie projector, a stereo speaker, a super-zoom camera, and more.
Skip the sevens and experience true smartphone innovation with Moto Z Droid with Moto Mods.
